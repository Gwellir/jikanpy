        the most basic forms of life in the world. They exist without any goals or
        purposes aside from simply \"being.\" They are beyond the shackles of the
        words \"good\" and \"evil.\" Mushi can exist in countless forms and are capable
        of mimicking things from the natural world such as plants, diseases, and even
        phenomena like rainbows.\n\nThis is, however, just a vague definition of these
        entities that inhabit the vibrant world of Mushishi, as to even call them
        a form of life would be an oversimplification. Detailed information on Mushi
        is scarce because the majority of humans are unaware of their existence.\n\nSo
        what are Mushi and why do they exist? This is the question that a \"Mushishi,\"
        Ginko, ponders constantly. Mushishi are those who research Mushi in hopes
        of understanding their place in the world''s hierarchy of life.\n\nGinko chases
        rumors of occurrences that could be tied to Mushi, all for the sake of finding
        an answer.\n\nIt could, after all, lead to the meaning of life itself.\n\n[Written
